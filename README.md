Raw e-commerce transaction data is extracted from a CSV file, cleaned and validated using pandas, and loaded into an SQLite database.

## Data Source
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and is used only for educational purposes.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite
- Logging

## ETL Workflow
1. Extract data from CSV
2. Clean and transform data
3. Apply basic data quality checks
4. Load clean data into SQLite database

## Output
A clean and structured database table ready for analysis.

## Key Learnings
- Practical understanding of ETL pipelines
- Importance of data quality checks
- Hands-on experience with pandas and SQLite
